#Build tools
Provides an outline for the usage of the tools used while development.

##Assembler
asm.py is a modified version of the assembler written by [slu4](https://github.com/slu4coder/Minimal-UART-CPU-System)

I only added one feature, which I thought was essential to the process of writing in assembly(for my project), VARIABLES. Every other aspect of the assembler remained the same.
